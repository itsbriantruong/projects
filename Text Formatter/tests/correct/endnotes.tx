We are going to have a little bit of fun with endnotes. 
Since it's easy to write a short endnote like this:\endnote{You passed the short endnote.} since it's all in one line. 

However once we get into multi-line endnotes, things start to get a little
trickier. Like here's one for instance:\endnote{Congratulations, 
you passed a two-line endnote} Here is some following text. 

What if it's more than two lines though? Then we might get unexpected 
results.\endnote{Congrats, you passed a many line endnote. The next thing
to make sure is that you can put an endnote in the middle of your text
and have it still process correctly. However, my code isn't ready for that
quite yet.}
