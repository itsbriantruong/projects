   We are going  to have a little  bit of fun with  endnotes. Since it's
easy to write a short endnote like this:[1] since it's all in one line.

   However once we  get into multi-line endnotes, things start  to get a
little trickier. Like here's one for instance:[2] Here is some following
text.

   What if it's more than two lines though? Then we might get unexpected
results.[3]

   Results:
[1] You passed the short endnote.
[2] Congratulations, you passed a two-line endnote
[3] Congrats, you  passed a many  line endnote.  The next thing  to make
    sure is that you  can put an endnote in the middle  of your text and
    have it  still process correctly.  However, my code isn't  ready for
    that quite yet.
