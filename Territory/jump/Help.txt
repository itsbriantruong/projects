Commands may be typed in any mixture of case. However, this program does
not accept abbreviations for commands. The commands themselves must be
typed with the same letters as given below. Arguments must also be of
proper format as shown below (their case does not matter as well).

Commands:
<row> <column> This places a spot of the current player's color on the
               given row and column of the board (must provide integers).
               Rows are in the range (1, size of board] and columns
               similarly follow (as the board is a square).
clear          Abandons the current game (if there is one in progress) and
               clears the board to its starting position (all square neutral).
               Since playing is stopped, it will not resume until it is called
               again.
quit           Quit game.
auto <P>       Stop any current game. Player, given by <P> (either Red or Blue),
               will become an automated (AI) player when the game (re)starts.
               Blue is set to an AI by default.
manual <P>     Stop any current game. Player, given by <P> (either Red or Blue),
               will become a manual player (moves are taken in from the terminal)
               when the game (re)starts. Red is set to manual by default.
set <r> <c> <n> <color>
               Stop any current game. Place <n> spots of the given <color>
               (denoted by: 'B','b','R', or 'r') onto the square located at
               row <r>, column <c>. When <n> is 0, <color> is ignored and
               the square is cleared. <r> <c> must be a valid move.
size <N>       Stop any current game. Clear the board to its initial
               configurations, and set the size of the board to <N> squares.
               The board itself contains N x N squares relative to <N>.
               Any given <N> < 0 will ignored.
move <N>       Stop any current game. Set the number of the next move to
               <N>, where <N> is a number greater than or equal to 1.
dump           Print the current state of the board in a standard format.
help           Prints this message with information on each command.
